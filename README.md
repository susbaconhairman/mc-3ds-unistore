Minecraft 3DS UniStore repo for game customization, for the Universal Updater

Now featured as a recommended UniStore in the Universal-Updater! https://github.com/Universal-Team/Universal-Updater/commit/aaf77fa51a5d570d60b7dc42fe79e749ca8338de

If you want to have something added to the UniStore, contact me on Discord, my username is skribbler#1095. The item must not already be in the file repo (linked below), and it cannot be a world as I don't think there is a way to have worlds be installed via a UniStore.
