Minecraft 3DS UniStore repo for game customization, for the Universal Updater

If you want to have something added to the UniStore, contact me on Discord, my username is skribbler#1095. The item must not already be in the file repo (linked below), and it cannot be a world as I don't think there is a way to have worlds be installed via a UniStore.

File repo: https://archive.org/details/mc-3ds-customization-repo
